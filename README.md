## Best Practices

### Message Batching

The `bullying` and `unsafe` commands analyze a single text input per request. If you're analyzing a conversation, concatenate a **sliding window of recent messages** into one string rather than piping each message individually. Single words or short fragments lack context for accurate detection and can be exploited to bypass safety filters.

```bash
# Bad — each line analyzed in isolation
cat messages.txt | while read line; do tuteliq bullying "$line"; done

# Good — analyze the full conversation
tuteliq bullying "$(cat messages.txt)"
```

The `grooming` command already accepts multiple messages and analyzes the full conversation in context.

### PII Redaction

Enable `PII_REDACTION_ENABLED=true` on your Tuteliq API to automatically strip emails, phone numbers, URLs, social handles, IPs, and other PII from detection summaries and webhook payloads. The original text is still analyzed in full — only stored outputs are scrubbed.

## The Mission: Why This Matters

Before you decide to contribute or sponsor, read these numbers. They are not projections. They are not estimates from a pitch deck. They are verified statistics from the University of Edinburgh, UNICEF, NCMEC, and Interpol.

- **302 million** children are victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse every year. That is **10 children every second**. *(Childlight / University of Edinburgh, 2024)*
- **1 in 8** children globally have been victims of non-consensual sexual imagery in the past year. *(Childlight, 2024)*
- **370 million** girls and women alive today experienced rape or sexual assault in childhood. An estimated **240–310 million** boys and men experienced the same. *(UNICEF, 2024)*
- **29.2 million** incidents of suspected child sexual exploitation were reported to NCMEC's CyberTipline in 2024 alone — containing **62.9 million files** (images, videos). *(NCMEC, 2025)*
- **546,000** reports of online enticement (adults grooming children) in 2024 — a **192% increase** from the year before. *(NCMEC, 2025)*
- **1,325% increase** in AI-generated child sexual abuse material reports between 2023 and 2024. The technology that should protect children is being weaponized against them. *(NCMEC, 2025)*
- **100 sextortion reports per day** to NCMEC. Since 2021, at least **36 teenage boys** have taken their own lives because they were victimized by sextortion. *(NCMEC, 2025)*
- **84%** of reports resolve outside the United States. This is not an American problem. This is a **global emergency**. *(NCMEC, 2025)*

End-to-end encryption is making platforms blind. In 2024, platforms reported **7 million fewer incidents** than the year before — not because abuse stopped, but because they can no longer see it. The tools that catch known images are failing. The systems that rely on human moderators are overwhelmed. The technology to detect behavior — grooming patterns, escalation, manipulation — in real-time text conversations **exists right now**. It is running at [api.tuteliq.ai](https://api.tuteliq.ai).

The question is not whether this technology is possible. The question is whether we build the company to put it everywhere it needs to be.

**Every second we wait, another child is harmed.**

We have the technology. We need the support.

If this mission matters to you, consider [sponsoring our open-source work](https://github.com/sponsors/Tuteliq) so we can keep building the tools that protect children — and keep them free and accessible for everyone.
